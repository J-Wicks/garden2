    distribution:`It is commercially cultivated in Peru, forming a major portion of that country's flower exports. \n Gypsophila paniculata is now widely distributed in North America. It is classed as an invasive species in places around the Great Lakes, such as the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and the Chicago region, and in the Pacific Northwest.`,
    description:`It is a popular ornamental garden subject, and thrives in well-drained alkaline to neutral soils in full sun. Numerous cultivars have been selected, of which 'Bristol Fairy' and 'Rosenschleier' (with pale pink double flowers) have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n G. paniculata is much used in the floristry trade (where it is often simply called "gyp") providing an effective backdrop for larger or more structured blooms.`,
